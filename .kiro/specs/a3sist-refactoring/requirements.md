# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The A3sist project is a Visual Studio extension that provides AI-powered code assistance through a multi-agent system. The current codebase requires comprehensive refactoring to establish proper folder structure, complete missing implementations, and create a robust, maintainable architecture. This refactoring will transform the existing prototype into a production-ready Visual Studio extension with proper separation of concerns, complete agent implementations, and comprehensive testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure that follows .NET and Visual Studio extension best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is opened THEN the folder structure SHALL follow standard .NET solution patterns with clear separation between core logic, UI, and shared components
2. WHEN examining the project structure THEN each agent SHALL have its own dedicated folder with consistent organization
3. WHEN building the solution THEN all projects SHALL compile without errors and follow consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN shared components SHALL be properly organized in logical folders (Interfaces, Models, Enums, Utils)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all agent implementations to be complete and functional, so that the multi-agent system can perform its intended tasks effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is invoked THEN it SHALL implement the IAgent interface completely with proper error handling
2. WHEN the system processes a request THEN the Orchestrator SHALL properly coordinate between agents and handle failures
3. WHEN agents communicate THEN they SHALL use the standardized messaging system with proper serialization
4. WHEN an agent fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt recovery through the FailureTracker agent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection and service registration, so that the system is testable and follows SOLID principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension starts THEN all services SHALL be properly registered in the DI container
2. WHEN agents are created THEN they SHALL receive their dependencies through constructor injection
3. WHEN testing agents THEN dependencies SHALL be easily mockable through interfaces
4. WHEN the system runs THEN there SHALL be no direct instantiation of concrete classes in business logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling throughout the system, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation occurs THEN appropriate log messages SHALL be written with correct log levels
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN it SHALL be properly caught, logged, and handled gracefully
3. WHEN the system fails THEN users SHALL receive meaningful error messages
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN logs SHALL provide sufficient context to understand the problem

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management for the extension, so that settings can be managed and persisted correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension starts THEN configuration SHALL be loaded from appropriate sources (settings, config files)
2. WHEN users change settings THEN they SHALL be persisted and applied immediately
3. WHEN agents need configuration THEN they SHALL access it through a centralized configuration service
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to defaults

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete Visual Studio integration layer, so that the extension works seamlessly within the IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL register properly with Visual Studio and appear in the Extensions menu
2. WHEN users interact with code THEN the extension SHALL provide context-aware suggestions and actions
3. WHEN the extension processes code THEN it SHALL integrate with Visual Studio's editor services
4. WHEN users invoke extension commands THEN they SHALL execute reliably with proper UI feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit and integration tests, so that the system is reliable and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL have corresponding unit tests with good coverage
2. WHEN agents interact THEN integration tests SHALL verify the communication works correctly
3. WHEN the build runs THEN all tests SHALL pass consistently
4. WHEN changes are made THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass or be updated appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API design for agent communication, so that the system is extensible and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents communicate THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces and message contracts
2. WHEN new agents are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing communication system
3. WHEN the system processes requests THEN the API SHALL handle versioning and backward compatibility
4. WHEN external systems integrate THEN they SHALL have clear API documentation and examples
